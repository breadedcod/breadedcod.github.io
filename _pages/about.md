### What I do

I help organizations fight their digital entropy and focus on critical business performance outcomes. 

### Sectors I have worked in

| Education   | Geoscience | Aviation        | R&D |

| Finance | Retail     | Government | Architecture        |
| Law  | Non-Profit | Media and Marketing        | Healthcare          |

### And away from work
I like to hang out in the hills riding bikes and skiing skis. Movement and open spaces are important to me.
